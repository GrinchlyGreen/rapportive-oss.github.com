Rapportive Code
===============

Welcome to the [Rapportive](http://rapportive.com/) developer site!


Raplet Platform
---------------

Raplets let you take data you have about people, and show it in Gmail next to your email
conversations. The basic API is super simple. You could be pulling information from your
in-house CRM or other database in no time!

Open Source Projects
--------------------

Rapportive is built using tons of free and open-source software, and we are very grateful to the
developers and maintainers of all those great tools and libraries.

From time to time, when appropriate, we release code from Rapportive as open source
[on GitHub](https://github.com/rapportive-oss). Here are some featured projects:

* [Ampex](https://github.com/rapportive-oss/ampex)
  (Ruby, written by [Conrad](https://github.com/ConradIrwin)):  
  Now you can write anonymous blocks in Ruby with less syntactic noise.

* [Buena Vista](https://github.com/rapportive-oss/buena_vista)
  (Ruby, written by [Martin](https://github.com/ept)):  
  Punctuation-aware string truncation.

* [Git Bits](https://github.com/rapportive-oss/git-bits)
  (Bash scripts and other languages, written by all of us):  
  Assorted Git utilities and higher-level commands to support our workflows.

* [Deferrable Gratification](https://github.com/samstokes/deferrable_gratification)
  (Ruby, written by [Sam](https://github.com/samstokes)):  
  Turns your asynchronous code from a hairy mess of callbacks into elegant, composable patterns.
